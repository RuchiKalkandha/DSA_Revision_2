# DSA Revision Repository

Welcome to my DSA Revision Repository! This repository is dedicated to tracking my journey of revising Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and collecting solutions to the questions I solve.

## Introduction

In this repository, I aim to revise and solidify my understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms. By revisiting concepts and documenting solutions, I hope to ensure that my knowledge remains sharp and up-to-date.

## Table of Contents

(This is a list of topics i have planned to revisit)
1. Pattern problems
2. Arrays
3. Strings
4. 2D Arrays
5. Searching & Sorting
6. Backtracking
7. LinkedList
8. Stack and Queues
9. Greedy
10. Binary Trees
11. Binary Search Trees
12. Heap and Hashing
13. Graphs
14. Tries
15. Dynamic Programming
16. Bit Manipulation
17. Segment Trees

## Progress Tracking

To keep track of my revision and solutions, I will:
- Maintain a detailed log of revisited questions
- Document the approach, time complexity, and code for each solution

## Contribution Guidelines

While this repository is primarily for my personal use, feel free to explore and provide suggestions. If you find any errors or have recommendations, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy revising! Let's keep our DSA skills sharp together.
